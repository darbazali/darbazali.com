        <p>
          I'm Darbaz Ali, a mission-driven Web Developer and UX/UI Designer
          based in South Kurdistan. I craft digital web apps from the very first
          idea with tools like design thinking to be user-centric, turning the
          process into pixels with (Xd and Sketch), then transforming pixels
          into code with Node.js and React.js, ultimately shipping the product
          with platforms like Heroku and Firebase.
        </p>

        <h3>How I got here?</h3>
        <p>
          Last year, I tried to build my SASS startup. The idea was to tackle a
          well know problem, CAPTCHAs. I wanted to reinvent the solution from
          scratch, the platform was the web, so I had to learn everything
          related to digital products.
          <br />
          <br />
          After I created a light-weight MVP, I applied to YC 2020 winter batch,
          but unfortunately, the idea wasn't' good enough to put in front of
          investors and raise some money. But high enough, throughout that
          process, I gained such skills that made me a whole new different
          person and gave me an upper hand to have an unfair advantage for the
          next opportunity.
        </p>

        <h3>What I'm looking to go next?</h3>

        <p>
          Now, I'm looking for an opportunity to join a supportive, growing
          community and passionate team that let me apply my acquired skills to
          tackle interesting problems and (possibly) creating the next big thing
          of the internet.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sounds familiar? If so, I'm always interested in new challenges.
